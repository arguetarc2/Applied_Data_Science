# Applied_Data_Science
Personal practice projects offered for completion and a Capstone Project to be completed for the Applied Data Science Program from MIT

Content consists of the following folders and respective project work:
- Foundations of Data Science: Diabetes Analysis on Pima Indians
  - Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis to analyze different aspects of diabetes in Pimas Indigenous People
  - Practice Project: Satistics for Data Science
      - Satistics for Data Science: Answered questions relating to statistics as a warmup/basic practice
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Fantasy Sports Clustering Analysis
  - Conduct Cluster Analysis on past season performance to identify player potential for the upcoming season
- Machine Learning: Superkart (Supermarket, Department, Food mart, etc) owned by a particular business
    - Objective: Provide a suitable model to predict total sales of the business's stores for the upcoming quarter
- Practical Data Science: Pre-Capstone Elective Project, Capstone Project
    - Pre-Capstone Elective: Classification Elective Project
        - Objective: Build an ML model to identify leads that are more likely to be converted to paying customers, Find factors driving the lead conversion process, Create a profile of leads most likely to convert
    - Capstone Project: Loan Default Prediction
        - Objective: Build a classification model to predict clients that are more likely to default on their loan, while providing recommendations to the bank on important factors that affect loan default versus clients that successfuly pay off their loans
- Deep Learning: Food Image Classification
  - Build a classification model to help label images of food into three different categories.
  - Note: .zip folder containing data/images for this project are unavailable due to large file size
